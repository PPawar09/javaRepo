1) Build LifeCycle/ Build Phase in Maven are :-

		- Validate  : to make sure pom file is fine.
		- Compile   : Src is compiling.
		- Test		: Run the Junit test.
		- Package
		- Integration
		- Verify
		- Install / Deploy
		

		* Example Run the Command mvn test (here sequence Validate, Compile and Test)

		* If we use Install it will run all the steps as above.
		
		* We can attach plugin to do build lifecycle.
		
		* There many pluggin define in Super or Parent POM.xml
		
2) POM Structure 


		- Name     : Define the name of project
		- Version  : version of project.
		- Packaging  : Artifact we need like jar war
		- Dependencies : Need of our project defined here.
		- Plugins : like deploy webapp to tomcat server. so there is a plugin for it like for other stuff.

3) Multi Module Maven Example

		* There are three project 
				- business layer which has sub project
				- data layer  which has sub project
				- model layer which has sub project
				
			Model layer is used by business and data layer.
			Data layer depends on Model. 
			Business layer depends on data and Model.
			
		* Entire configuration start with parent project . thats the first pom
		  here packaging is pom (not jar or ect) it mean it is parent pom for other pom defined in 
		  <modules>
			<module>model</module>
			<module>data</module>
			<module>business</module>
		  </modules>
