This article demonstrates supporting multiple output formats for your Spring 4 MVC application using Spring’s 
ContentNegotiatingViewResolver. We will be generating application output in XML, JSON, PDF, 
XLS and HTML format, all using Annotation based configuration. 

Let’s get going.

ContentNegotiatingViewResolver is an implementation of ViewResolver, which uses the requested media type 
(based on filetype extension, URL parameter specifying type of output format or accept header) 
to select a suitable View for a request. ContentNegotiatingViewResolver does not resolve view by 
itself but delegates to other ViewResolver you can configure to handle specific views
(XML,JSON,PDF,XLS,HTML,..).

1) This use annotation based configuration of Spring framework instead on xml

Url based output like pdf,json xml and htm is default
