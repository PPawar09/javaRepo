1) What is XMLBeans?   [Ref https://xmlbeans.apache.org/]
   XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types. XMLBeans provides several ways to get at the XML, including:

   > Through XML schema that has been compiled to generate Java types that represent schema types. In this way, you can access instances of 
     the schema through JavaBeans-style accessors after the fashion of "getFoo" and "setFoo".
     The XMLBeans API also allows you to reflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model.
   > A cursor model through which you can traverse the full XML infoset.
   > Support for XML DOM

3) 	The advatages of XMLBeans over DOM/SAX parsers are:
    > DOM parsers create an instance of whole of the document in one go which may eat up memory if document is large. XMLBeans does 
	   incremental unmarshalling of XML and hence uses memory only when required.
	> SAX parsers can’t write to XML and moreover the developer needs to write event handlers.
