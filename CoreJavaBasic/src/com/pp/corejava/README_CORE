    post increment : i++ is nothing but post increment which means CPU executes some instruction 
                     (depends on the program you are in) before it increments i.
                     
    pre-increment  : ++i is pre-increment which means before the CPU executes some instruction 
                     (depends on the program you are in) it increments it first and then executes it
