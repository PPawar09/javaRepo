1) JAXB VS XML Bean : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1362030/jaxb-vs-apache-xmlbeans
					: https://jaxb.java.net/tutorial/
   
   There are several way to work with Jaxb for xml binding or processing xml data.
   
   a) Xml with no schema : generate xsd from xml online, once you have xsd generate jaxb xml mapping java class
    					   using IDE right click on xsd and then generate JAXB class.
    					   Once you have JAXB class you can use regular logic to read xml info java obj or Java Object to xml.
    					   
   b) Xml with xsd : In this step no need to generate xsd from online.
   
   c) Online xsd generation : 	http://www.freeformatter.com/xsd-generator.html#ad-output

   JAXB, stands for Java Architecture for XML Binding, using JAXB annotation to convert 
   Java object to / from XML file. In this tutorial, we show you how to use JAXB to do following stuffs :

		Marshalling – Convert a Java object into a XML file.
		Unmarshalling – Convert XML content into a Java Object.
		Technologies used in this article

		JDK 1.6
		JAXB 2.0

   Working with JAXB is easy, just annotate object with JAXB annotation, later use jaxbMarshaller.marshal() or 
   jaxbMarshaller.unmarshal() to do the object / XML conversion.
   
3) xsd is just a formal representation of xml, analogous to 'Class' for an 'Object' . 
   You can have a compliant xml without an xsd (in which case the xsd is hidden). While it is true that we start 
   with xsd and generate java objects for the most part, you can do things the other way around as well.
