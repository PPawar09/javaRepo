******** Imp File in Angular ***************

app/app.module.ts

	Defines AppModule, the root module that tells Angular how to assemble the application. Right now it declares only the AppComponent. 
	Soon there will be more components to declare.

assets/*

	A folder where you can put images and anything else to be copied wholesale when you build your application.
	
environments/*

	This folder contains one file for each of your destination environments, each exporting simple configuration variables to use in your application. 
	The files are replaced on-the-fly when you build your app. You might use a different API endpoint for development than you do for production or maybe 
	different analytics tokens. You might even use some mock services. Either way, the CLI has you covered.

browserslist

	A configuration file to share target browsers between different front-end tools.
	
index.html

	The main HTML page that is served when someone visits your site. Most of the time you'll never need to edit it. 
	The CLI automatically adds all js and css files when building your app so you never need to add any <script> or <link> tags here manually.
	
main.ts

	The main entry point for your app. Compiles the application with the JIT compiler and bootstraps the application's root module (AppModule) to run in the browser. 
	You can also use the AOT compiler without changing any code by appending the--aot flag to the ng build and ng serve commands
